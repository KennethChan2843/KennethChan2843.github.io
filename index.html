				<hr>
				<p>
					I'm a third year computer science student who was hired as a software developer for NCR from May to
					December 2019 during my first and second work term. This position allowed me to gain valuable work
					experience and I learned a lot during these eight months. The following report will provide an
					overview of my job and detail the learning goals that helped me focus during the work terms.

						<h2>Job Description</h2>
						<p>
							As a software developer at NCR, I was assigned to the TxInfinity project where I worked with
							a team of eight people. My team was responsible for back-end development and I was given a
							mix of development and DevOps tasks. In order to familiarize myself with NCR's development
							processes, I learned to use a wide range of tools that I had not used before. These include
							Jira, Bitbucket, Cucumber, Jenkins, AquaSec, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, DBeaver, Cassandra,
							and Postman. In addition, the job required me to write bash scripts, Java code, and code
							using NCR's proprietary language. After being assigned a Jira story, I was responsible for
							writing code, test cases, and documentation. Communication and teamwork was essential in
							order to understand the requirements of a Jira story, create a solid implementation, and to
							demo the solution to the team and product owners. These eight months were very valuable
							because it gave me numerous opportunities to develop skills and attempt things that I had
							never done before.

				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>
					For work terms one and two, I created six goals to help me focus on what I wanted to learn and
					improve on while working at NCR.
				</p>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
						<h3>Understanding Requirements & Specifications (Term 1)</h3>
						<p>
							Starting work was difficult because I did not understand what my team was talking about
							during meetings. This goal is about understanding the work that NCR does. I need to be
							familiar with banking terminology in order to have context when requirements and
							specifications are being discussed. In addition, I need to be familiar with the issue
							tracking tool, Jira. I would like to explore the different types of stories that are
							tracked, as well as determine the workload required to complete each type of story. I wish
							to develop my understanding of story points in order to be able to accurately predict
							workload and plan sprints.
						</p>
						<p>
							I now understand most of the acronyms that are used when discussing requirements and
							specifications during meetings. I also understand the different types of transactions that
							are possible and the flow of a transaction. I have worked on many Jira stories and I now
							have experience with development and DevOps related tasks. I've implemented new features,
							worked on change requests, fixed bugs, created tests cases, and managed build processes and
							tools. I have a better understanding of the work that we do and I am able to confidently
							assign story points during meetings.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-tools"></span>
						<h3>Processes & Tools Familiarization (Term 1)</h3>
						<p>
							I am not familiar with Scrum, nor with many of the tools used by NCR. For this goal, I would
							like to understand the general workflow and tools used in software development. I need to
							go through the entire development cycle in order to be exposed to all of the tools that I
							will be using to complete my tasks. I will learn about the framework and infrastructure
							which includes Scrum, Jira, and BitBucket. In addition, I'll learn about the development
							tools such as Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, Postman, DBeaver, and Cassandra. Finally, I'll
							learn about the testing tools which consists of Cucumber and Jenkins.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having gone through an entire program increment, I am now accustomed to Scrum. I've
							participated in program increment planning, standup, sprint planning, backlog grooming,
							retrospective, and demos. I can use Jira to track issues assigned to me and BitBucket to
							find source code and create pull requests. I'm familiar with Maven dependencies, building
							images with Docker, and maintaining my local Kubernetes cluster. I can use Postman to call
							API endpoints and DBeaver to inspect Cassandra databases. With Cucumber, I am able to create
							test cases and Jenkins allows me to verify that my solutions do not break anything.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-user-friends"></span>
						<h3>Oral Communication & Teamwork (Term 1)</h3>
						<p>
							This is the first time that I have worked with a team which means that this goal focuses on
							collaborating with my team members. I would like to improve my communication skills and
							successfully work with team members to solve problems. First, I should get to know my team
							and be aware of everyone's area of expertise. If I am unsure of what I am suppose to be
							doing and/or if I have any questions, then I should ask the appropriate team member for
							help. Before I start implementing my solution, I should review it with others to ensure that
							I do not waste time with a flawed design.
						</p>
						<p>
							Having worked with my team for four months, I am not afraid to ask my team for help when I
							have a problem or question. On the other hand, as I've worked on more Jira stories and
							expanded my knowledge, others have reached out to me to ask for help. I was also able to
							help new hires with the onboarding process by explaining and guiding them through the
							processes and tools that we use. Furthermore, I am comfortable when I am demoing my solution
							to my team and product owners.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-code-branch"></span>
						<h3>Code Analysis & Quality Assurance (Term 2)</h3>
						<p>
							In the second work term, my increase in experience meant that I was able to understand story
							requirements, specifications, and code more easily. This goal is about applying my knowledge
							and analytical skills. I should review pull requests and make comments regarding standards,
							style, and logic. If the pull requests do not have any issues, then I should mark them as
							approved; otherwise, it should be marked as needing more work. Also, I should contribute to
							discussions during meetings in order to share my ideas. Having multiple perspectives to
							review and contribute will ensure that nothing is overlooked.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since this was my second work term, I had gained a lot more experience and I was able to
							more effectively contribute to pull request reviews. I have caught logic and syntax errors
							before the code was merged to the master branch. Something I need to work on is contributing
							to discussions during meetings. At times, I had trouble asking questions and was unable to
							provide insight to my team members. This issue is something that I would like to work on in
							the future.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-search"></span>
						<h3>Identifying Areas of Improvement (Term 2)</h3>
						<p>
							As I've gotten familiar with the codebase, I have noticed code that has failed to meet
							coding standards. This goal is about improving the quality of the existing codebase which
							includes identifying code that could be cleaned up and made more efficient, removing unused
							or redundant code, and refactoring code to conform to coding standards. If I was unable to
							make these changes immediately, then I would talk to my team lead to create a Jira story. A
							healthy codebase will increase efficiency, productivity, extendibility, and readability
							because it's easier to navigate, understand, and maintain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall, I'm happy with the outcome of this goal. When I did not understand why code was
							implemented the way it was, I would ask a co-worker for their perspective to see if I was
							missing anything. I would fix the issue if it was within my scope or I would bring it to the
							attention of my team lead. Something that I could do next time is to follow up on the issues
							that I've identified and see if they have been worked on or resolved.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-book"></span>
						<h3>Personal Organization & Time Management (Term 2)</h3>
						<p>
							This learning goal was inspired by a co-worker who recorded his day to day activities in a
							physical notebook. I wanted to improve my ability to plan and finish Jira stories and
							keeping a daily journal sounded like a good plan. To begin with, I would write down what I
							expected to accomplish for the day. As the day progressed, I would record my activities, any
							issues that I faced, and how I resolved these issues. Finally, I would see if I was able to
							finish the day's tasks and take note of anything that I should keep in mind for the next
							day.
						</p>
						<p>
							This journal has allowed me to look up past issues and recall their solutions. I'm not
							wasting time trying to fix issues that I have already solved. I can also apply lessons that
							I've learned from past activities to future solutions. Furthermore, it has been useful for
							daily standup, especially after the weekend when I need a refresher of what I was doing the
							week before. The journal has allowed me to keep track of events which helps me finish Jira
							stories in a timely manner. It has proven to be a useful tool and I would benefit from
							continuing to use it.

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							It was my first time in the workplace and these eight months at NCR have been invaluable.
							The culture is friendly and promotes an environment that allows its employees to grow. From
							the beginning, the interview was professional and I felt comfortable answering questions.
							Ever since I met my team, they have been supportive in my goals and education. Also, having
							twenty co-ops working here made the workplace transition from an academic setting manageable
							and less intimidating. I had the opportunity to develop my technical and transferable
							skills, while engaging in recreational activities through ping pong and company events. NCR
							is a great place to get your feet wet and I would recommend having a work term here.
